- How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
Testing is a fundamental part of the development process, helping to ensure that our product is meeting the requirements set out before us. By creating a set of requirements that expects us to meet certain functionality and follow best practices for security, we give ourselves a guideline not only for development, but for testing as well. 

- How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
Simply acquiring user needs can sometimes be a difficult process and requires an adaptive approach. Effective elicitation and assessment of old systems are integral steps in being able to properly interpet user needs into a tangible list of requirements.  

- How do I approach designing software?
The ideal method for approaching software design is by bringing multiple tools, resources, and thought processes to the table. Taking a multi-faceted approach to every step of the development lifecycle, even those that do not work with the code itself, is highly valuable to the overall success of a project. Software design will almost always be a collaborative effort and taking into account many different skills and perspectives is key to creating the best possible product.
